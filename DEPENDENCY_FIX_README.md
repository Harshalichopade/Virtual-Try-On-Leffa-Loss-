# Virtual Try-On Leffa Loss - Dependency Fix Instructions

## Why You're Getting Errors but Your Friend Isn't

The issue is **environment differences** between Google Colab and Kaggle:

1. **NumPy Version Conflict**: You have NumPy 2.2.6, but most ML packages require NumPy < 2.0
2. **Google Colab Constraints**: Colab has strict version requirements that conflict with newer packages
3. **Missing Version Pins**: Your requirements.txt doesn't specify exact versions

## Quick Fix for Google Colab

Copy and paste this into a Colab cell and run it:

```python
# Step 1: Fix core scientific packages
!pip install numpy==1.26.4 --force-reinstall --quiet
!pip install scipy==1.13.1 --force-reinstall --quiet
!pip install scikit-learn==1.5.1 --force-reinstall --quiet

# Step 2: Install PyTorch with CUDA support
!pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 --quiet

# Step 3: Install TensorFlow compatible version
!pip install tensorflow==2.15.0 --quiet

# Step 4: Fix specific conflict packages
!pip install protobuf==4.25.3 pyarrow==15.0.2 --quiet

# Step 5: Install remaining Virtual Try-On requirements
packages = [
    "transformers==4.40.0", "diffusers==0.27.2", "accelerate==0.30.1",
    "gradio==4.26.0", "opencv-python==4.9.0.80", "scikit-image==0.22.0",
    "omegaconf==2.3.0", "einops==0.7.0", "fvcore==0.1.5", "pycocotools==2.0.7",
    "timm==0.9.16", "torchmetrics==1.4.0", "safetensors==0.4.3",
    "tokenizers==0.19.1", "peft==0.11.1", "regex==2024.5.15",
    "cloudpickle==3.0.0", "onnxruntime==1.18.0", "imageio==2.34.1",
    "tqdm==4.66.4", "psutil==5.9.8"
]

for package in packages:
    !pip install {package} --quiet

print("✅ Installation complete! Please restart your runtime.")
```

## After Installation

1. **Restart your runtime**: Runtime -> Restart Runtime
2. **Test imports**: Run this to verify everything works:

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
import tensorflow as tf
from transformers import pipeline

print(f"NumPy: {np.__version__}")
print(f"PyTorch: {torch.__version__}")
print(f"TensorFlow: {tf.__version__}")
print("✅ All packages working!")
```

## Alternative: Use the Jupyter Notebook

I've created `Colab_Dependency_Fix.ipynb` with a complete step-by-step solution. Upload it to Colab and run all cells.

## Key Differences Between Kaggle and Colab

| Aspect | Kaggle | Google Colab |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| NumPy Version | Usually < 2.0 | Often 2.2+ (causes conflicts) |
| Pre-installed ML packages | More compatible versions | Stricter version requirements |
| CUDA Setup | Pre-configured | Requires specific torch versions |
| Environment Management | More flexible | Stricter dependency enforcement |

Your friend's success on Kaggle is because Kaggle's environment is more ML-friendly with better default package versions!
